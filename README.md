NFL Weekly Performance Predictor
=========

Simple data-driven algorithm to predict weekly passing, rushing, and receiving leaders in the NFL.

Week-by-week predictions are stored in the `predictions/` folder.

*Note:* Since the NFL is far from a data set, this algorithm will never be 100% accurate. But if you want to make a $5 bet with your friend on which QB/RB/WR trio will amass the most yards, this will help you.
